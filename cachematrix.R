##Our aim in this experiment is to write a pair of functions, namely,
#makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve that cache the inverse of a matrix


#makeCacheMatrix is a function which creates a special matrix object that can
#cache its inverse for the input (which is an invertible square matrix)


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  a<-NULL
  set <- function(b){
    x<<-b
    a<<-NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <-function(Inverse)a <<-inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse =setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


#cacheSolve is a function which computes the inverse of the special matrix
#returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
#(and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the
#inverse from the cache


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  y <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(y)) {
    message("getting casched data")
    return(y)
  }
  mat <-x$get()
  y <-solve(mat,...)
  x$setInverse(y)
}
